# FinalProject
I plan on doing a website about checking out books in the library. 
so for the html requirements I was going to do a from where you could 
look up the available books from a form you would type in a books name and it would show you the books with the  name and img of the book that you could check out, and a img i would then style my page to meet all the requirements for the css part 

for the javascript part i would use the filter function to filter throught the books that are available, I would use the adding and removing elements to add and remove the books from the readersId or a storage place where I could store which user has which books kinda like a library card this would also meet the multiple files requirement i would meet the local storage requirement also 

**things I dont have and where could I use them
I am not sure how I would use these javascript requiements and I would like some input 
1) async/await and promises
2) network requests / call API
3) read querystring

for the hard parts I think I am gonna use javascipt toolchain, a styling framework 
and maybe a static site generator but I am not sure how I would meet these requirements to be honest I am just choosing three from the list that equal 25, if there are some better that I could use I would appreciate the assistance.
